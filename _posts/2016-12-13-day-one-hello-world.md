title: "Day One: Hello, World!"

This is Day One.

I'm going to try and write at least once per day - even if it's just a short paragraph or two. I might end up rolling these little posts into a weekly 'digest' of sorts - we'll see.

{% highlight python %}
>>>print("Hello, World!")
{% endhighlight %}

I've got some goals for the coming days/weeks/months. I'm trying to use this journal as a way of organizing my thoughts and documenting important 'life lessons'.

A few of my current goals:

1. Finish the Mary Street Wellness website.
2. Study for the MCSA exam (Part 1 at the moment, more to follow).
3. Work on Lyon (a line of business web app for our family business)

That's it for now. I will write some more tomorrow.
